#This is the driver program for my final project
#Bonuses I plan on using are randomness and puzzles
#You will come across an old house in a neighborhood, and it is your choice whether or not you go in
#But if you do, its like a casino but not as much where you can gamble, but you can go to different parts and rooms
#games like roulette, higher or lower, etc.
#it needs atleast 12 rooms/interactions
